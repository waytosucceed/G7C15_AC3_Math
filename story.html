        <p>Once upon a time in a magical
            land, there were two kingdoms,
            Kingdom A and Kingdom B,
            separated by a vast forest. The
            only way to travel between the
            two kingdoms was through a
            narrow road that cut through the
            forest. This road was known as
            the Transversal Road.<br><br>
            Along this road, travellers
encountered various intersections
where different paths crossed the
Transversal Road at different
angles. These intersections 
played a crucial role in the
journey between the two
kingdoms. They need to answer
the specific questions correctly to
reach the kingdom.

    The path opened, and they joyously entered
Kingdom B, celebrated for their wisdom. The
Transversal Road became a symbol of
knowledge and unity between the two

kingdoms.
